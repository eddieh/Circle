# Welcome to Circle! #

This is a local events-finder app built by Eddie Hillenbrand, Josh Conner and Sam Olson for our [CS 477](http://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS477_WWW/index.html "CS 477 Homepage") class at [Northern Arizona University](http://nau.edu/).

The backend uses the excellent [Parse](https://parse.com/) app platform, which gives you a super-simple noSQL database, great iOS and Android (we hear) classes to easily access data, and a nice REST API for our web client.

The front end was built using [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/), [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Kalendae](https://github.com/ChiperSoft/Kalendae), [Ajax Upload](http://valums.com/ajax-upload/)\* and probably a ton of stuff I'm forgetting right now.

The iOS app was built in XCode and uses the aforementioned really nice Parse classes, [SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage), a modified version of [this Google Places for iOS demo](https://github.com/jdruid/Google-Places-for-iOS-5), and - again - a bunch of other stuff.

### Hope you like it! ##

\* The only AJAX upload we could get working on Safari. Safari, get on it already? Firefox has had File API for 10+ major versions now...
